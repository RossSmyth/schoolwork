# schoolwork
Repo of all MATLAB-based schoolwork I have done. Doens't include some stuff such as the data used as I don't strictly own the rights to that.

## Structure
Should follow something roughly like this:

|-- course
|   |-- Project
|   |   |-- script.m
|   |   |-- report.pdf

## Contents
I'll tabulate the contents of the work here later.
