# NOTICE
If you are a student looking here, it is very likely that projects have changed since I have done these classes. If they haven't, just realize that the only person you are hurting is yourself.
# schoolwork
Repo of coursework I have done. Mostly MATLAB except one, robotics that is mainly C.
A lot of things are missing because of Simulink libraries used I do not own the rights to. Primarily in Feedback Controls.

## Structure
Should follow something roughly like this:
```
|-- course  
||-- Project  
|   |   |-- script.m  
|   |   |-- report.pdf
```
