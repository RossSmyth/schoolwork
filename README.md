# NOTICE
If you are a student looking here, it is very likely that projects have changed since I have done these classes. If they haven't, just realize that the only person you are hurting is yourself.
# schoolwork
Repo of all MATLAB-based schoolwork I have done. Doens't include some stuff such as the data used as I don't strictly own the rights to that.

## Structure
Should follow something roughly like this:
```
|-- course  
||-- Project  
|   |   |-- script.m  
|   |   |-- report.pdf
```
## Contents
I'll tabulate the contents of the work here later.
